Fortran-lang/fftpack Documentation
==================================

Please see the [GitHub Pages site] for the Fortran-lang/fftpack documentation.
To generate a local copy of the corresponding HTML files, 

1. Set your present working directory to the Fortran-lang/fftpack project root directory,
2. Execute `ford API-doc-FORD-file.md`, and 
3. View the result by opening the newly generated `API-doc/` subdirectory in a web browser.

This subdirectory contains 
1. Documentation files for previous incarnations of fftpack in the [legacy](./legacy) sudirectory and
2. Files supporting the [API-doc-.md](../API-doc-FORD-file.md) project file that [FORD] uses to generate the GitHub Pages site.
