## Getting started
### Get the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack.git
cd fftpack
```

### Build with [fortran-lang/fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)
Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a package manager and build system for Fortran.   
You can build using provided `fpm.toml`:
```bash
fpm build
fpm test --list
fpm test <test_name, see `fpm.toml` or list>
```
To use `fftpack` within your `fpm` project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
fftpack = { git="https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack.git" }
```

## Build with CMake
This library can also be built using CMake.  For instructions see [Running CMake](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/).  CMake version 3.24 or higher is required.

## Build with Meson
This library can also be built using Meson. The following dependencies are required:
- a Fortran compiler
- [meson](https://mesonbuild.com) version 0.57 or newer
- a build-system backend, *i.e.* [ninja](https://ninja-build.org) version 1.7 or newer

Setup a build with

```sh
meson setup build
```

You can select the Fortran compiler by the `FC` environment variable.
To compile and run the projects testsuite use

```sh
meson test -C build --print-errorlogs
```

If the testsuite passes you can install with

```sh
meson configure build --prefix=/path/to/install
meson install -C build
```

## Documentation
See the our [GitHub Pages site] for documentation generated by [FORD] from the fortran-lang/fftpack [project file].

## References 
Although fortran-lang is _not_ interface-compatible with any of the following libraries, each contains documentation that might be useful for different reasons:
- **Recommended reference:** The [scipy.fftpack] documentation contains succinct description of the storage sequences for function results that match those in fortran-lang/fftpack, e.g., the location of the real and imaginary parts of the `rfft` function result.
- **Theory reference:** The [documentation for the GNU/gsl FFT routines], which are also based on netlib/fftpack, provides some useful definitions of FFT terminology and represenations of the analytical forms of the Discrete Fourier Transform nicely formatted by [LaTeX].
- **Historical reference:** The [netlib/fftpack] library on which fortran-lang/fftpack is useful for understanding several fortran-lang/fftpack design choices, e.g., the procedure dependencies.
