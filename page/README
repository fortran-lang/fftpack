                        DFFTPACK V1.0
*****************************************************************
        A Double precision clone by Hugh C. Pumphrey  of:
                      FFTPACK
               version 4  april 1985

The gzipped tar file dp.tgz contains a complete copy of the FORTRAN
sources of fftpack, with everything converted to double precision. If
you do 

gunzip dp.tgz
tar xvf dfftpack.tar 

You will get a directory called dfftpack with all the source code in
it. There is also:

(*) a Makefile which I have tweaked to work on modern Linux and Solaris
systems. The comments in this file document the changes made.

(*) a file doc which was supplied with fftpack and which has been 
altered to reflect the changes made in the change to double precision.

(*) A file doc.double which details the changes I made to the source code

Please send any comments or bug reports to hcp@met.ed.ac.uk . Please
also report if you get dfftpack to build successfully on any system
other than Linux or Solaris. 

The original FFTPACK was public domain, so dfftpack is public domain
too. It is released in the hope it will be useful to someone. There is 
no warranty of any sort covering this software.
